# Bellabeat: Trends on Smartwatch Users  



## Introduction

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. These 
products helps inform and inspire women around the world. The founders of the company 
believe that there are more opportunities to grow their business. With this, they have discussed 
with the marketing team on how they could gain insight on their customer’s usage of their 
products. As part of the marketing analytics team, I was tasked to look into one of the products 
and analyze the the smart device usage data in order to gain new findings on how their 
customers are already using their device. The goal in my analysis is to find trends in the smart 
device usage and present how my findings can help influence the company’s marketing strategy.
